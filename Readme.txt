Note(s):
--------
Technology used:
	* Angular.js
	* Bootstrap 3
	* LESS
	* JSON
	* HTML5
	* PrePros CSS Compressor
	* Sublime


Setup:
======
Project folder should be setup on local host to be viewed otherwise it will not work. I have used PrePros (https://prepros.io/downloads) which provides node server and setup local host by it self.

CSS:
=====
custom.less file in less folder combines all other LESS files and generates compressed custom.css file in css folder.
